## Known limitations

- Builder import support is intentionally scoped and is not a full Mermaid parser.
- Visual editing depth is strongest for flowcharts and sequence diagrams.
- Mermaid family behavior can still vary, especially for advanced syntax.
- TextMate grammar highlighting is broad, but Mermaid syntax is large and evolving, so some constructs may still receive lighter highlighting than others.

## Local development

If you want to build or test Mermaid Studio locally, you will need a standard Node.js / npm workflow.

Minimum useful commands:

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run package
```

If those commands are unfamiliar, learn the basics of:
- cloning a Git repository
- installing Node.js and npm dependencies
- running npm scripts from a terminal
